Manuals
There's an official manual at "Writing R extensions" (https://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/r-release/R-exts.html).
Hadley Wickham published a book dedicated to writing R packages (http://r-pkgs.had.co.nz/), which for me is the
definitive guide.

In this post I will give you a quick overview of how to use Hadley Wickham's tools to build your own R package, documentation website included.
