# Data simple
My Data Science website at
[luisvalesilva.github.io/datasimple/](http://luisvalesilva.github.io/datasimple/).

*Data simple* is a blog-like collection of articles about my toy Data Science
projects, focusing heavily on Python and R. All code walk-through articles are
backed by a GitHub repo containing the full code used in the analyses.

*Data simple* is a work in progress.
