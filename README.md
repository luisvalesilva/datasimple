# Data simple
My Data Science website at [luisvalesilva.github.io/datasimple/](http://luisvalesilva.github.io/datasimple/).

*Data simple* is a blog-like collection of articles about my toy Data Science projects, focusing heavily on
Python and R. The articles generally include the code behind the analyses and are always backed by a GitHub
repo containing the full code used in the analyses.
