      <br />
      <p>In his book
        <a href="http://adv-r.had.co.nz/Performance.html" target="_blank">Advanced R</a>, Hadley Wickham
        put it like this:
      </p>
      <blockquote><i>R is not a fast language. This is not an accident. R was purposely designed to
        make data analysis and statistics easier for you to do. It was not designed to make life easier
        for your computer.</i></blockquote>

      <p>This is a fact, not an opinion. Execution time may be more or less important to you, but
        with R speed comes second to providing an high level framework for easy data analysis. That
        being said, there is no reason why you should not design your code to avoid excedingly long
        run times.
      </p>

      <p>Some time ago, I "inherited" an R script at work that implemented a task I needed to repeat
        and build on. As I started reading through it, I came across the following comment:
      </p>

      <blockquote><i># Takes > 2 hours to complete! Run on HPC.</i></blockquote>

      <p>I immediately raised an eyebrow at that, since I couldn't see any reason why it should ever
        take that long. This article is a walk-through of how some minor changes brought execution time
        from two hours down to about five minutes. Beware this is not an exhaustive tutorial on
        strategies to speed up R code. It will rather show you an example of simple rules that can go a
        long way making some specific code run faster.
      </p>

      <header>
        <h3>The original slow code</h3>
      </header>

      <p>In simple terms, the original script used as input a data frame containing several million
        observations (rows) of a few variables. It looped through the rows and performed an operation
        according to some condition. The result of the operation performed on all observations in each
        row was added to a new data output frame as a new row. The following is a highly simplified mock
        example illustrating the situation. It uses the <code1>sqrt()</code1> function as the mock operation
        on two variables (columns) and <code1>rbind()</code1> to store the result as a new row of the output
        data frame.
      </p>

      <pre>
        <code class="language-r">
# The mock input data: data frame with large number of rows (n)
n <- 2000000
input <- as.data.frame(cbind(rnorm(n, mean = 100, sd = 1),
                             rnorm(n, mean = 100, sd = 1)))

# Initialize data frame to collect outputs
output <- as.data.frame(matrix(NA, nrow = 0, ncol = 2))

# Loop through all rows, perform operation and 'rbind' output
for(row in 1:nrow(input))) {
  # Loop through all columns and perform operation
  result <- sqrt(input[row, ])  # Some operation

  # Collect result by 'rbind'ing to output data frame
  output <- rbind(output, result)
}</code>
			</pre></br>

			<p>The goal of the present analysis is to document the execution time of the original code and
        illustrate the impact of some simple code optimizations. If you want to do this kind of analysis you
        should consider using something like the package <i>microbenchmark</i>.
        <i>microbenchmark</i> will run your piece of code many times and output summary statistics
        of the execution times. Here I will use a different approach. I will set up repeated runs of the mock
        example above with increasing input data sizes and time each one of them to document the increase in
        execution time. As you can see in the code below, I use the function
        <code1>system.time()</code1> to register the execution time of each run. The elapsed time (in
        seconds) is then stored in a matrix together with the corresponding
        data size (number of rows of the input data frame). Another option, similar to using
        <code1>system.time()</code1> but more convenient for longer pieces of code, would be to use the
        function <code1>proc.time()</code1>. A plot illustrating the results follows the code.
      </p>

		  <pre>
			  <code class="language-r">
number_of_Ns <- 26 # Number of different sample sizes

# Matrix to collect execution time for each sample size
perform_slow <- matrix(NA, nrow = number_of_Ns, ncol = 2)
n <- 0

# Loop to run the task with all different sample sizes
for (iter in 1:number_of_Ns) {
  output_slow <- as.data.frame(matrix(NA, nrow = 0, ncol = 2))
  input <- as.data.frame(cbind(rnorm(n, mean = 100, sd = 1),
                               rnorm(n, mean = 100, sd = 1)))

  # Time execution of task for current iteration's data size
  time <- system.time(
    for(row in 1:nrow(input)) {
      result <- sqrt(input[row, ]) # Some operation (vectorized over columns)
      output_slow <- rbind(output_slow, result)
    }
  )
  cat(iter, ' - ', time[[3]], 'sec.\n') # Print message to track progress

  # Collect sample size (n) and respective execution time
  perform_slow[iter, 1] <- n
  perform_slow[iter, 2] <- time[[3]]

  # Increment sample size (n) for next iteration
  n <- n + 1000
}</code>
    	</pre></br>

      <header>
        <h3>Code vectorization</h3>
      </header>

      <p>R allows you to use code vectorization, as do many other programming languages. You should never use
        a loop when you can vectorize the code. Vectorized code is more elegant, easier to read, easier to
        debug and much faster to execute! The code should then be optimized by replacing the nested <code1>for
        loop</code1> (the timed code above) by the vectorized implementation:
      </p>

		  <pre>
        <code class="language-r">
output <- sqrt(input)</code>
      </pre></br>

      <p>This is definitely what you would want to do in this situation. The problem here is that in the real
        code represented by this mock example, the operation performed on each row actually depended on the
        result of the operation on the preceding row. Because of that, vectorization was unfortunately not an
        option. Read on to find out what else you can do.
      </p>

      <header>
        <h3>Initialize output data frame at its final dimensions</h3>
      </header>

      <p>A major speed bottleneck in this code is caused by the repeated use of
        <code1>rbind()</code1>. The function <code1>rbind()</code1>
        is slow, particularly as the data frame gets bigger. You should never use it in a loop. The
        right way to do it is to initialize the output object at its final size right from the start and then
        simply fill it in with each turn of the loop.
      </p>

      <p>Of course sometimes you do not know the final size of your output object in advance. That was
        actually the case in my real situation too. Not all rows of the input data resulted in an output and,
        for the ones that did, a variable number of new rows was produced. I could however estimate the upper
        boundary for the output size: my output data frame could have at most 10 times the number of rows of
        the input data. In that case the solution is simply to intialize your data frame at its maximum
        possible value and at the end use the following code to dump empty rows:
      </p>

		  <pre>
        <code class="language-r">
output <- output[complete.cases(output), ]</code>
      </pre></br>

      <p>This mock example is not including that situation, though. It simply initializes the output data
        frame at its exact final dimensions. Here's what the code looks like now and the plot of the resulting
        execution speed.</p>

		  <pre>
				  <code class="language-r">
# Matrix to collect execution time for each sample size
perform_fill_in <- matrix(NA, nrow = number_of_Ns, ncol = 2)
n <- 0

# Loop to run the task with all different sample sizes
for (iter in 1:number_of_Ns) {
    output_fill_in <- as.data.frame(matrix(NA, nrow = n, ncol = 2))
    input <- as.data.frame(cbind(rnorm(n, mean = 100, sd = 1),
                                 rnorm(n, mean = 100, sd = 1)))

    # Time execution of task for current iteration's sample size
    time <- system.time(
        for(row in 1:nrow(input)) {
            result <- sqrt(input[row, ])
            output_fill_in[row, ] <- result # Fill in data frame
        }
    )
    cat(iter, ' - ', time[[3]], 'sec.\n') # Print message to track progress

    # Collect sample size (n) and respective execution time
    perform_fill_in[iter, 1] <- n
    perform_fill_in[iter, 2] <- time[[3]]

    # Increment sample size (n) for next iteration
    n <- n + 1000
}</code>
    </pre></br>

      <header>
        <h3>dplyr and <code>bind_rows</code></h3>
      </header>

      <p>It is often the case that you have no way of estimating the final size of the output data frame.
        Do not despair, Hadley Wickham's package <i>dplyr</i> comes to the rescue. If you don't know
        <i>dplyr</i>, believe me when I tell you there's a lot it can do for you. In this case I will use
        <i>dplyr</i>'s replacement for <code1>rbind()</code1>, the function <code1>bind_rows()</code1>.
        We go back to initializing the output data frame with no rows and then adding the result of each turn
        of the loop as a new row in the output data frame. But when you now use <code1>bind_rows()</code1>
        rather than <code1>rbind()</code1> it runs much, much faster. Here's the code and results plot.</p>

		  <pre>
				  <code class="language-r">
library(dplyr)
# Matrix to collect execution time for each sample size
perform_dplyr <- matrix(NA, nrow = number_of_Ns, ncol = 2)
n <- 0

# Loop to run the task with all different sample sizes
for (iter in 1:number_of_Ns) {
  output_dplyr <- as.data.frame(matrix(NA, nrow = 0, ncol = 2))
  input <- as.data.frame(cbind(rnorm(n, mean = 100, sd = 1),
                               rnorm(n, mean = 100, sd = 1)))

  # Time execution of task for current iteration's sample size
  time <- system.time(
    for(row in 1:nrow(input)) {
      result <- sqrt(input[row, ])
      output_dplyr <- bind_rows(output_dplyr, result) # dplyr's bind_rows
    }
  )
  cat(iter, ' - ', time[[3]], 'sec.\n') # Print message to track progress

  # Collect sample size (n) and respective execution time
  perform_dplyr[iter, 1] <- n
  perform_dplyr[iter, 2] <- time[[3]]

  # Increment sample size (n) for next iteration
  n <- n + 1000
}</code>
    </pre></br>

      <header>
        <h3>What about the <code>apply</code> family?</h3>
      </header>

      <p>The functions in the <i>apply</i> family are basically wrappers for
        <code1>for loop</code1>s.
        There is a widespread misconception that they speed up code, but that is not true. I believe the
        reason for this is historical, as it was apparently true in the early days of R and in the S
        language. Nowadays, however, the <code1>apply</code1> functions are used because they make code more
        readable (if you are familiar with them, that is; some people think
        <code1>for loop</code1>s, being language agnostic, are easier to read). Using the
        <code1>apply</code1> functions also helps prevent bugs, as it is easier to keep a nice and tidy
        function (and its use with <code1>apply</code1>) than the code in the <code1>for loop</code1>.
        There are those who will swear that in R <code1>for loop</code1>s are the root of
        all evil. Others will tell you they are so sick of the <code1>apply</code1> snobs they will shoot the
        next person who dares even pronounce the word <i>apply</i>. Don't be fooled. Ultimately, this is a
        matter of taste more than anything else. Personally, I like them both.
      </p>

      <header>
        <h3>Conclusion</h3>
      </header>

      <p>Keeping in mind some simple code optimization rules such as the ones illustrated
        here is an easy way to cut execution times of many common tasks. For more complex situations, there
        are nice tools you can use to diagnose speed bottlenecks in your code (I would suggest RStudio's
        package <a href="https://github.com/rstudio/profvis" target="_blank">profvis</a>). They can be
        extremely useful if your script or program is more involved and complex.
      </p>

      <p>You should definitely not spend hours optimizing code to save hours of a one off script run.
        Your time is much more valuable than your computer's. There's no reason not to learn a few ways to
        optimize your code, though. The added flexibility that comes with the decrease in execution time
        will repeatedly save you time in your future coding.
      </p>

      <p>As a final note, let me just add that if you liked this article you will love the <i>Performant
        code</i> section of Hadley Wicham's <a href="http://adv-r.had.co.nz/" target="_blank">Advanced R</a>
        book.
