  			<h3>Or how to write your own R packages</h3>
			</header>
      <br />
			<p>So you've been using R for a little while now. You learned your way around the
			base library and you found a couple of useful packages you like to keep at hand.
			Inevitably, you've also written a few general purpose functions you use recurrently.
			The question now becomes whether to keep copying the files into	the folder of every
			new project or rather build them into your very own R package you can just import
			when needed.
		  </p>

			<p>As with almost anything in life, the answer is not straightforward and there are
			advantages and disadvantages to both approaches. Copying your functions into every
			project folder gives you a lot of flexibility, but there will be a lot of unnecessary
			code duplication. Consolidating that code into a centralized package, on the other hand,
			will keep it neatly organized and necessarily well designed, but it can be difficult
			to ensure backwards compatibility.
		  </p>

			<p>When I started coding in R I went with the decentralized approach every time, not
			 because it was the right choice but because writing a package takes some
			 amount of learning, while copying files around is something anyone can do. This post
			 will hopefully get you to the point where you can make a more informed choice.
		   </p>

			 <p>And this is only one reason to pack your code up in a package, even if, arguably,
				 the most common for beginners. The main reason to write a package is probably
				 sharing your code, with collaborators or the R-using world.
 		   </p>

 		  	<h3>Formal guides to writing R packages</h3>
 		  </header>

			<p>If you've already started writing your own packages and are looking for the official guide,
			you can find it at <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/r-release/R-exts.html" target="_blank">Writing R extensions</a>.
			You will be better off sticking to Hadley Wickham's wisdom, though, so just go straight
			to his definitive guide: <a href="http://r-pkgs.had.co.nz/" target="_blank">R packages</a>.
			If you don't know who Hadley Wickham is, then let me say I'm impressed: you haven't even been
			using R long enough to have come across ggplot or dplyr and you're already thinking
			of developing your own R package. Kudos to you!
			</p>

			<p>Irrespective of whether or not you've been touched by the 'Hadleyverse' before,
				if what you're looking for is a quick guide	to get you up and running, you've come
				to the right place.	This post will give you all you need to write your first
				R package. We won't be using Hadley's book on the subject, but we'll still be using
				<a href="https://github.com/hadley/devtools"  target="_blank"><i>devtools</i></a>,
				<a href="https://github.com/hadley/staticdocs"  target="_blank"><i>staticdocs</i></a>
				and <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/roxygen2/README.html"  target="_blank"><i>roxygen2</i></a>,
				three of his packages. By the end of this short read, you'll be ready to write your
				first R package, documentation website included!
			</p>

			<header>
			 <h3>Create your package</h3>
		 </header>

		 <p>The first thing you need to do is get Hadley Wickham's R package development
			 and documentation helper packages (that's right, packages written to help develop
			 other packages): <i>devtools</i> and <i>roxygen2</i>. Next you'll want to set your
			 working directory and create your package folder.	This will create all the required
			 files, plus a folder called 'R' to host your functions. I won't go into more detail
			 here, but you will definitely	want to go learn more about the created files as your
			 packages get more complex.</p>

      <pre>
        <code class="language-r">
# Get and load the helper packages
install.packages(c('devtools', 'roxygen2'))

# Navigate to package's destination directory and create it
setwd('location/of/your/package')
devtools::create('Rpckg')</code>
		</pre></br>

		<p>With this you're done creating your package and won't need the previous steps
			until you want to create a new one. Now you need to add some functions.</p>

		<header>
		 <h3>The development cycle</h3>
		</header>

		 <h4>1. Add function(s)</h4>

<p>Adding functions is simple: save your code in a file with the extension <code1>.R</code1>
			in the 'R' folder in your new package. I like to keep every function in
			its own separate file, but it will work just as well if you have more than one function
			per file. Now comes a really cool part: writing the documentation.
		Yes, I did say 'cool' and that's thanks to <i>roxygen2</i>. Add the documentation
	to each function using <code1>roxygen</code1> comments as illustrated below.
	This will be compiled into standard R documentation and can also be used to easily make
	a nice documentation website.</p>

	<pre>
		<code class="language-r">
#' Compute the triple of input number
#'
#' This function multiplies an input number by three.
#' @param input Number to triple. No default.
#' @param verbose Boolean indicating whether to display message. Defaults to \code{TRUE}.
#' @return Triple of input number as numeric value.
#' @examples
#' triple(23457)
#' triple(342, verbose = F)
#' @export

triple <- function(input, verbose = TRUE) {
    if(verbose) {
        cat('Computing triple of', input, '\n')
    }
    return(input * 3)
}</code>
		</pre></br>

		<h4>2. Compile documentation and test</h4>

		<p>You are now ready to compile the documentation file and load the development
			version of your function. You can check that the documentation looks good and
			test the function. In this stage you will make any required changes and reload
		to check again, going through as many iterations as you need. Here's the code.</p>

	<pre>
		<code class="language-r">
# Compile documentation
devtools::document()
# Load development version
devtools::load_all()

# Check documentation
?triple

# Test function
a <- triple(2476937509)
b <- triple(2476937509, FALSE)</code>
		</pre></br>

		<h4>3. Install the package</h4>
		<p>That's it, your package is ready to use. You can use <code1>devtools</code1>
			to install it, as follows, and then use it as you would any other R package.
			Whenever you want to add functions to your package just go through steps 1.
			and 2. above. As many times as you want.
	</p>

		<pre>
			<code class="language-r">
setwd('location/of/your/package')
devtools::install('Rpckg')

# Load in standard way
library('Rpckg')
a <- triple(2476937509)

# Or keep your namesapces clean
a <- Rpckg::triple(2476937509)</code>
			</pre></br>

			<header>
			 <h3>Extras</h3>
			</header>

			<h4>Easy publishing</h4>
			<p>Even if you're not planning on submitting your package to CRAN, you can still
				publish and distribute it for easy installation by others. You are probably using
				some kind of version control (if you are not, you should start now) and you can
				leverage that to easily publish your package. <i>Git</i> is currently the most common
				system and <i>devtools</i> provides functions to install packages directly from
				<i>GitHub</i> or <i>BitBucket</i>, among other options. It's as simple as running
				<code1>devtools::install_github('github_username/repo')</code1>. You will see it
				in action in the next section here below.
		</p>

		<h4>Documentation website</h4>
		<p>Hopefully you have found the documentation easy to write with <i>roxygen2</i> and <code1>roxygen</code1>
			comments. Documentation is definitely an important part of software development.
			If you're not convinced, here's a bonus for you: you can now use the same documentation
			you have already built in your package to create a nice documentation website with three
			lines of code. All you need to do is install Hadley Wickham's <i>staticdocs</i> and
			it will do all the work for you. The result is a cool documentation website, just like
			the ones you may be used to seeing for Hadley Wickham's packages.
	</p>

	<pre>
		<code class="language-r">
# As of this writing, staticdocs is not yet on CRAN; grab the development version
devtools::install_github("hadley/staticdocs")
# Navigate to package's parent directory and build site
# (use 'examples = FALSE' if you don't want your examples to run)
setwd('location/of/your/package')
staticdocs::build_site('Rpckg', '/website/location/', examples = FALSE)</code>
	</pre></br>


			<p>That's it. You have now created a fully functional R package and a slick
				documentation website to go with it. There's a few other quick informal guides
				to writing your own R package, just like this one, out there.	Two cool blog posts
				I found really interesting are Hilary Parkers'
			<a href="https://hilaryparker.com/2014/04/29/writing-an-r-package-from-scratch/" target="_blank">Writing an R package from scratch</a>
			and Andrew Brooks' <a href="http://brooksandrew.github.io/simpleblog/articles/personal-R-package/" target="_blank">DIY building an R package</a>.
			I encourage you to check them out.
		  </p>

			<p>On a final note, RStudio, the <i>de facto</i> R IDE, includes great functionality
				for package development. You may want to check that out, as a great alternative to
				this more manual approach.
