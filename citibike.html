          <br />
          <p>CitiBike is the public bicycle sharing system serving New York City. The service opened
			  in May 2013 and is currently the largest bike sharing program in the United States.
			  A nice thing about it is that CitiBike share their data for anyone to play with.
			  Here I will do just that, using Python. The following is a summarized description of the analysis,
			  including data manipulation (with <a href="http://pandas.pydata.org/">Pandas</a>)
			  and map visualizations (with <a href="http://folium.readthedocs.org/en/latest/">Folium</a>).
			  You can find the full code in a Jupyter notebook on
			  <a href="https://github.com/luisvalesilva/exploring_citibike">GitHub</a>.<br/><br/>
			  CitiBike's data can be found on their
			  <a href="https://www.citibikenyc.com/system-data" target="_blank">System Data website</a>.
			  The data are organized in monthly subsets (each in its own <i>.csv</i> file)
			  and are available since July 2013, soon after the citibike service opened.
			  The last available month, as of this writing, is October 2015 (last month).
			  Using data from one whole year seems most appropriate. It will provide
			  a manageable amount of data and also capture yearly patterns. For this exercise
			  I will thus use all 2014 data, the only full year available so far. The data have been
			  pre-cleaned before uploading, for example by removing trips taken by staff and any trips below 60
			  seconds in length. This means they are ready to use, likely with little
			  need for additional cleaning.</p>
	          <header>
	            <h3>Preparing the data</h3>
	          </header>
			  <p>The first step is to download the 12 <i>.csv</i> files for all months in 2014.
				  We can read in the file names and then use a <i>for loop</i> to load the data as
				  12 Pandas <i>DataFrames</i> appended to a list.</p>
			  
			  <pre>
				  <code class="language-python">
import glob
# Get file names
filenames = glob.glob('*.csv')

import pandas as pd
# Loop through file names and read the data
dfs = []
for file in filenames:
    print('Reading ' + file)
    dfs.append(pd.read_csv(file))</code>
			</pre></br>
			
			<p>Here's a screenshot showing an example of what the data look like after loading
				in Pandas. You can see the included variables and two observations each for the
				August and the September <i>DataFrames</i>.</p>
				
			<!-- Image -->
			<div class="box alt">
				<div class="row 50% uniform">
					<div class="12u"><span class="image fit"><img src="images/citibike/df_august.png" alt="" /></span></div>
					<div class="12u"><span class="image fit"><img src="images/citibike/df_september.png" alt="" /></span></div>
				</div>
			</div>
				
			<p>Turns out the data are not as clean as I originally thought. The
				time stamps (variables <i>starttime</i>	and <i>stoptime</i>) are
				formatted in one way in months up to August and in a different way in
				the remaining months.	You can see examples in the screenshots above.
				One way to consolidate the format is to use Pandas' <i>to_datetime</i>
				function to convert the variables to the appropriate data type (Pandas
				uses NumPy's <i>datetime64</i>). A little <i>for loop</I> helps save
				some typing. For the months from September on I need to include information
				about the format, as it changes.
			</p>
			
			<pre>
				<code class="language-python">
print('Converting month:')
for month in range(12):
    if month < 8:
        print('... ' + str(month + 1))
        dfs[month]['starttime'] = pd.to_datetime(dfs[month]['starttime'])
        dfs[month]['stoptime'] = pd.to_datetime(dfs[month]['stoptime'])
    else:
        print('... ' + str(month + 1))
        dfs[month]['starttime'] = pd.to_datetime(dfs[month]['starttime'], format = '%m/%d/%Y %H:%M:%S')
        dfs[month]['stoptime'] = pd.to_datetime(dfs[month]['stoptime'], format = '%m/%d/%Y %H:%M:%S')</code>
			</pre></br>
			
			<p>Now that the timestamps are consistent, I can concatenate the datasets
				into one single <i>DataFrame</i> containing all data. Finally, I can
				use the pickle module (part of the Python standard library)	to save the
				clean Pandas <i>DataFrame</i> for future use (a concept known as serialization).
				This will write a <i>.pkl</i> file to disk that I can save and	easily read back into
				memory at any point in the future.
			</p>
			
			<pre>
				<code class="language-python">
# Concatenate DataFrames
df = pd.concat(dfs)
# Pickle data
df.to_pickle('citibike_2014.pkl')</code>
			</pre></br>			
			

		<p>Let's move on and get more familiar with the data. There are several rather high level questions
			we can quickly address to get an overview of the data. The code below shows how to compute a few
			of them. The results show that our 2014 dataset includes <b>8,081,216</b> observations of <b>15</b>
			variables. There were <b>332</b> CitiBike stations and <b>6,811</b> different bikes in use.
		</p>

		<pre>
			<code class="language-python">
df = pd.read_pickle('citibike_2014.pkl') # Read data
df.shape # How many observations and variables are there
df['bikeid'].unique().shape # Number of individual bikes
df['start station id'].unique().shape # Number of citibike stations</code>
  		</pre></br>

		<p>There are many ways we could go about exploring the data now. In this analysis I will be
			focusing on comparing the use of the different citibike stations in the network, particularly
			according to number of trips and trip duration. The <b>final goal</b> is to build
			<b>visualizations of total trip counts and trip durations on maps of the citibike station network.</b>
		</p>
		
		<header>
			<h3>Interactive map of CitiBike station use</h3>
		</header>
		
		<p>I will start by looking at trip counts and trip durations, to get a better view of the data.
			One way to look at trip	counts is to plot number of trips per day over the entire year of 2014.
		</p>
		
		<pre>
			<code class="language-python">
import matplotlib as mpl
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
plt.style.use('ggplot')

# Compute trip counts / day
df.index = df['starttime'] # Set 'starttime' variable as the index
countsPerDay = df.starttime.resample('D', how = ['count'])

# Plot trip counts
countsPerDay.plot(kind = 'area', stacked = False, figsize = (15, 5),
                  color = 'darkorange', linewidth = 2, legend = False)
plt.tick_params(axis = 'both', which = 'major', labelsize = 18)
plt.title('Number of trips / day\n')
plt.xlabel('')
plt.ylabel('Number of trips')</code>
		</pre></br>
		<!-- Image -->
		<div>
			<div class="box alt">
				<div class="row 50% uniform">
					<div class="10u"><span class="image fit"><img src="images/citibike/daily_trip_counts.png" alt="Daily trip counts"></span></div>
				</div>
			</div>
		</div>
			
		<p>The plot shows a general trend of increasing number of trips from the Winter months towards
			the Summer and a decrease thereafter, going back to harsher weather.
			Regular sharp decreases in daily trip counts are also clearly seen, corresponding to weekends
			and holidays.</br></br>
			In order to visualize trip durations I can plot an histogram of the <i>tripduration</i> variable.
			The histogram reveals that most trips are rather short,	with most frequent durations not longer
			than 10 minutes. Durations longer than 30 minutes are quite rare. Here I am excluding all trips
			with durations longer than 1 hour, representing rare outliers. 
		</p>
		
		<pre>
			<code class="language-python">
# Collect all trips shorter than 1 hour
duration_mins = df.loc[(df.tripduration / 60 < 60)][['tripduration']]
duration_mins = duration_mins / 60 # In minutes

# Plot the distribution of trip durations
plt.rcParams.update({'font.size': 16})
duration_mins.hist(figsize = (8,5), bins = 15, alpha = 0.5, color = 'orange')
plt.tick_params(axis = 'both', which = 'major', labelsize = 18)
plt.title('Distribution of trip durations\n')
plt.xlabel('Duration (min.)')
plt.ylabel('Trip counts')</code>
	  	</pre></br>

				<div class="7u"><span class="image fit"><img src="images/citibike/hist_trip_duration.png" alt=""></span></div>
			</div>
		</div>

		<p>We can now work on mapping station use. I will build the map using trip start stations, so I
			first need to prepare the data. The idea is to make a new <i>DataFrame</i> containing the
			data need to build the interactive map. The first step is to collect the subset of
			variables with information on trip start stations. I then drop duplicate station observations,
			to keep only one row for each individual CitiBike station. Finally, I can compute total trip
			counts out of each station, as well as mean trip duration (using the original complete
			<i>DataFrame</i>). These values are stored in two new variables, <i>trip count</i> and
			<i>mean duration</i>, and added to the new <i>DataFrame</i>.
		</p>

		<pre>
			<code class="language-python">
# Build a table containing the stations - one observation per station
start_station = df.iloc[:,[3, 4, 5, 6]] # Keep only required variables
start_station.index = start_station['start station id'] # Index by start station id
start_station = start_station.drop_duplicates() # Keep only one row per station

# Compute trip counts and mean trip duration for each start station and add to table
count_start_station = df.groupby('start station id')['start station id'].count()
mean_start_station = df.groupby('start station id')['tripduration'].mean()
start_station['trip count'] = count_start_station
start_station['mean duration'] = mean_start_station</code>
	  	</pre></br>
			
		<p>I can now use Folium to make the interactive map of the station network.
			The map will include one marker for each station, with a color scale proportional
			to trip counts out of that station and marker size proportional to mean trip duration.
			Folium comes with a few tilesets you can use directly. I prefer the dark tileset from
			CartoBD, so I will be using that instead.
		</p>
		
		<pre>
			<code class="language-python">
import folium
from matplotlib.colors import Normalize, rgb2hex
import matplotlib.cm as cm

# Normalize trip counts
norm = Normalize(start_station['trip count'].min(), start_station['trip count'].max())
# Get dark tileset from CartoBD (https://cartodb.com/basemaps)
tileset = r'http://{s}.basemaps.cartocdn.com/dark_all/{z}/{x}/{y}.png'
# Build Folium map
start_station_map = folium.Map(location = [40.74, -73.99], width = 400, height = 600,
                               tiles = tileset,
                               attr = '&copy; <a href="http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright">OpenStreetMap</a> contributors, &copy; <a href="http://cartodb.com/attributions">CartoDB</a>',
                               zoom_start = 12)
# Loop through rows (one per station) and compute marker color (trip counts) and size (trip duration)
for index, row in start_station.iterrows():
    color = rgb2hex(cm.YlOrRd(norm(row['trip count'])))
    start_station_map.circle_marker(location = [row['start station latitude'],
                                                row['start station longitude']],
                                    popup = row['start station name'], # Add labels with station name
                                    radius = row['mean duration'] / 10,
                                    fill_color = color, line_color = color)
# Create the final html document
start_station_map.create_map(path = 'start_station_map.html')</code>
		</pre></br>
          
    	<p>And here is the final result. The maps show markers for all stations, each clickable
			to show the station name. Marker color is proportional to total trip counts
			(color scale shown next to the maps) starting at the station. Marker size is
			proportional to mean trip duration, from a minimum of 9.5 minutes up to
			a maximum of about 1 hour.

			<h3>Dynamic map of daily use of CitiBike stations</h3>
		</header>

		<p>This map lump together all trips taken in 2014 for each station. Another interesting way
			to look at the data is to compute trip counts per hour and see how they change during
			the day. The following code prepares the data for that, additionally separating weekdays
			and weekends, as different use of CitiBike can be expected.
		</p>
		
		<pre>
			<code class="language-python">
# Calculate trip counts per hour on weekdays and weekends
df_sub = df.loc[:, ['tripduration', 'starttime']] # Keep only 'starttime' and 'tripduration' variables
# Index dataframe by 'datetime64' data in 'starttime' variable
df_sub.index = df_sub['starttime']
weekdays = df_sub[df_sub.index.weekday < 5]
weekends = df_sub[df_sub.index.weekday > 4]
weekdays_countsPerHr = weekdays.groupby(weekdays.index.hour).size()
weekends_countsPerHr = weekends.groupby(weekends.index.hour).size()
# Plot counts / hour on weekdays and weekends
plt.rcParams.update({'font.size': 18, 'legend.fontsize': 20})
weekdays_countsPerHr.plot(kind = 'area', stacked = False, figsize = (10, 6), color = 'darkorange',
                          linewidth = 2, label='Weekdays')

weekends_countsPerHr.plot(kind = 'area', stacked = False, color = 'darkred',
                          linewidth = 2, label='Weekends')

plt.tick_params(axis = 'both', which = 'major', labelsize = 18)
plt.title('Number of trips / hour\n')
plt.xlabel('Time of day (hr)')
plt.ylabel('Number of trips')
legend = ax.legend(loc='upper left', frameon = False)</code>
	  		</pre></br>

			<!-- Image -->
			<div class="box alt">
					<div class="row 50% uniform">
						<div class="7u"><span class="image fit"><img src="images/citibike/hourly_trip_counts.png" alt=""></span></div>
					</div>
				</div>

			<p>The plot shows that there are two clear commuting peaks on weekdays. On weekends
				the use pattern is different, as expected, and there are less trips per hour.
				It would be interesting to visualize the dynamics of station use during the average weekday.
				In order to do that, I can build hourly maps of station use for every hour using weekday data
				and then use them to make a video illustrating the changes. The final result is a dynamic
				visualization of how trip count (marker color) and trip duration (marker size) change
				over the 24 hours on the average weekday.

			<p>This is it. I hope this gave you a little tast of how powerful Pandas is	to manipulate data
				and how easy Folium makes it to build interactive maps. Again, you can see the full code,
				including the analyses shown here and more, in a Jupyter Notebook file in this
				<a href="https://github.com/luisvalesilva/exploring_citibike">repo</a> on GitHub.
