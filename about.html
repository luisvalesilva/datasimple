			Hey, I'm Lu&iacutes. I'm a Computational biologist at NYU focusing on the study
      of meiosis, the	specialized cell division required for sexual reproduction.
      On my day job, I use Data Science to	draw insight from	deep sequencing genomics
      data. By night I let Data Science take me in other	directions.
      <!-- If you want to learn more about me check out my

			<br /><br />
			I started <i>Data Simple</i> as a platform to publish Data Science-related articles.
			It's still in its infancy, but I plan to post mostly data analyses and how-to
      articles.
			<br /><br />
			I hope you find them interesting and I welcome your feedback, including constructive
      criticism and corrections.
